#### Proving an Existential Statements

Recall that an **existential statement** takes the form,
$$\exists x \in  D \text{ such that }Q(x)$$
- This statement is true if, and only if, $Q(x)$ is true for at least one $x$ in $D$.

Two methods for **Constructive Proofs of Existence**:
1. Find an $x$ in $D$ that makes $Q(x)$ true. 
2. **Existential Generalization**: Provide a set of directions for finding an $x$ in $D$.

Two methods for **Nonconstructive Proof of Existence**
1. There *must* exists a value of $x$ that guarantees $Q(x)$, based on some prior theorem. 
2. Assuming that no $x$ exists leads to contradiction.

- This is equivalent to saying "Let $m$ represent twice the value of integer $n$"
